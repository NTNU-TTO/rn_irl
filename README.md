This is our implementation of KTHs brilliant Innovation Readiness Level framework.

The intention is to have a web tool that is both easily accessible and easy to use in meetings and workshops to assess and agreee where your project currently sits on the various IRL levels.
It is also possible to use it as a light weight project managament tool, as you can define targets and action points for each IRL level.

You can define project teams and access across organisations, faculties and departments as you see fit.

We recommend that you deploy this on an internal server.
A tutotorial on how to do this with a custom domain in Apache2 can be found here:

You are free to implement any changes you like to the source code to tailor it to your own and/or your organisations need.
The source code is provided as is with absolutely no guarantees that it is useful or fit for purpose.
