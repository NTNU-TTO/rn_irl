This is our implementation of KTHs brilliant Innovation Readiness Level framework.

The intention is to have a web tool that is both easily accessible and easy to use in meetings and workshops to assess and agreee where your project currently sits on the various IRL levels.
It is also possible to use it as a light weight project managament tool, as you can define targets and action points for each IRL level.

You can define project teams and access across organisations, faculties and departments as you see fit.

We recommend that you deploy this on an internal server.
A tutotorial on how to do this with a custom domain in Apache2 can be found here:
https://q-viper.github.io/2022/07/17/deploying-streamlit-app-with-custom-domain-in-apache2/

I've made a quick guide and some helpers for getting this up and running on Linux server below. 
Note that this is only tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, so if you're running something else YMMW.

RN IRL Setup Guide

# Install some basics.
apt install sqlite3
apt install python3-venv

# Create a group for users that need access to rn_irl folders without root access (this is optional, but probably good practice if you want to restrict root access):
sudo groupadd -gid 99 rn_irl

# Get the source code - doesn't matter where you place it at this time.
github clone https://github.com/NTNU-TTO/rn_irl
sudo chown root:rn_irl -R rn_irl

# Set up a persistent python environment to run in.
cd /etc
sudo python -m venv rn_irl
sudo chown root:rn_irl -R rn_irl

# Activate the virtual python environment.
source /etc/rn_irl/bin/activate

# Install required modules.
pip install streamlit
pip install bcrypt
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install sqlalchemy

# Move the source code inside the virtual python environment.
mv /path/to/your/local/github/clone/rn_irl /etc/rn_irl/bin

# Make the database persistent outside of the rn_irl environment
sudo mkdir /var/lib/rn_irl
sudo mv /etc/rn_irl/bin/rn_irl/irl.db /var/lib/rn_irl

# Edit secrets.toml and update the path to the database:
{db_details]
db_path = 'sqlite:////var//lib//rn_irl//irl.db

# Create symlink bash script:
sudo ln -s /etc/rn_irl/bin/rn_irl/ubuntu_helpers/rn_irl.sh /bin/rn_irl

# Copy service
sudo cp /etc/rn_irl/bin/rn_irl/ubuntu_helpers/rn_irl.service /lib/systemd/system/

# Reload, enable and run service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable rn_irl
sudo service rn_irl start

# Enjoy.
